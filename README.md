# SW-Engineering-Intership-Question
SW-Engineering-Intership-Question's Answer as Matlab Code

Question:

The matrix that has suitable number of components will be converted to the lower triangular matrix. 
By this way, we can threat to the input as pyramid. 
The start point is top of the matrix. Walking downwards and diagonally is the only way that algorithm can follow.
As a restriction, the algoritm can not touch to the prime number.
By using that, the algorithm must reach to the bottom and sum numbers that it touch.
The result will be the maximum sum of the numbers.
